- Don't sell, just help them see solution

**Proposals not closing?**
- Follow up! Most deals close after 3-5 touches

**This validates everything.**

Once you have one client, you:

2. Get a case study
3. Build confidence
4. Have revenue to invest

Then repeat the process to get clients 2, 3, 4...

**You don't need anything else to get started.**
