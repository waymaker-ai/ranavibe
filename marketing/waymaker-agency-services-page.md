## Problem Section

### The Traditional Development Problem

**Slow & Expensive**
Traditional agencies take 6-12 months for an MVP. Budget blows up. Timeline keeps slipping.

**AI Promises, AI Disappointment**
AI tools promise 10x speed, but deliver broken code. Endless debugging. Technical debt from day one.

**Wrong Team Structure**
Most teams are either too traditional (slow) or too AI-reliant (broken code). You need both.

---

## Solution Section

### Waymaker's AI-Native Approach

**We combine the best of both worlds:**

✅ **AI Acceleration** - We use AI for 80% of the heavy lifting
✅ **Human Expertise** - Architects ensure production-quality patterns
✅ **RANA Framework** - Our open-source standard prevents AI mistakes
✅ **Real Testing** - Every feature tested and deployed before completion

**Result:** 5x faster than traditional development, with enterprise-grade quality.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from hiring developers?**
A: We're 5x faster because we use AI for implementation while senior engineers handle architecture. You get a full team (engineering, design, QA) for less than one senior developer's salary.

**Q: What's RANA and why does it matter?**
A: RANA (AI-Assisted Development Standard) is our open-source framework that ensures AI writes production-quality code. It's like having a quality control system that prevents AI mistakes before they happen.

**Q: Do I own the code?**
A: Yes, 100%. Full ownership, no licensing fees, clean handoff. You can take it anywhere.

**Q: What if I need changes after launch?**
A: First 30 days of bug fixes are included. After that, you can hire us for ongoing work, or hand off to your team (we train them).

**Q: Can you work with my existing codebase?**
A: Absolutely. We can integrate with existing systems, refactor legacy code, or start fresh.

**Q: What industries do you work with?**
A: We've built products for SaaS, e-commerce, education, healthcare, fintech, and more. If it's a web application, we can build it.

**Q: Do you do mobile apps?**
A: We build mobile-responsive web apps. For native iOS/Android, we partner with specialized mobile agencies.

**Q: What's your tech stack?**
A: Modern, proven technologies: React/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase/PostgreSQL, Vercel/Railway. All production-grade, well-supported tools.
