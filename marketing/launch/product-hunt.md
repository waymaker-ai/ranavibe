The Rails of AI - Ship production LLM apps in minutes, not months

## Description (260 chars max)
RANA is a TypeScript-first AI framework with built-in testing, cost tracking, security, and multi-provider support. Everything you need to go from prototype to production without the complexity.

## Maker's Comment
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

We built RANA because we were frustrated with the state of AI frameworks. LangChain is powerful but complex. The Vercel AI SDK is simple but limited. We wanted both: the simplicity of Rails with the power needed for production AI.

What makes RANA different:

🧪 **Testing-First**: `aiTest()` for AI code, semantic matching, regression testing
💰 **Cost-Aware**: Real-time cost tracking, budgets, optimization suggestions
🛡️ **Secure by Default**: Prompt injection detection, PII redaction, audit logging
🔌 **Multi-Provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama - one unified API
📊 **Observable**: Built-in tracing, metrics, and error tracking
⚡ **Fast Setup**: `npx create-rana-app` → production in 5 minutes

We've been using RANA in production for 6 months and it's saved us countless hours. Now we're sharing it with the world.

Try it: `npm install @rana/core`

Would love your feedback! 🙏

## First Comment
Thanks for checking out RANA! Here's what we're most proud of:

1. **The 5-minute demo**: From `npx create-rana-app` to a deployed AI app in 5 minutes
2. **Cost savings**: Our users report 40-60% reduction in LLM costs
3. **Confidence to ship**: Testing AI apps used to be guesswork. Now it's not.

Questions we'd love your take on:
- What's the #1 pain point with your current AI framework?
- What features would make you switch?
