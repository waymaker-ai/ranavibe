## The Problem

### Traditional Development
**Slow & Expensive**
Traditional agencies take 6-12 months for an MVP. Budget blows up. Timeline keeps slipping. By launch, you're already behind competitors.

### AI-Only Development
**Fast but Broken**
AI tools promise 10x speed but deliver broken code. Endless debugging. Technical debt from day one. Security vulnerabilities everywhere.

### Wrong Team Structure
**Neither Works**
Most teams are either too traditional (slow) or too AI-reliant (broken). You need both working together.

---

## Our Solution: AI-Native Development

### What Makes Us Different

We combine **AI acceleration** with **human expertise** using our open-source **RANA Framework**:

| Approach | Speed | Quality | Cost |
|----------|-------|---------|------|
| Traditional | 1x | High | $$$$$ |
| AI-Only | 10x | Low | $$$ |
| **Waymaker** | **5x** | **High** | **$$** |

## Guarantee

### Our Quality Commitment

**If we deliver broken code, we fix it for free.**

Every feature we build must:
- ✅ Work in production (not just locally)
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Include loading & empty states
- ✅ Pass TypeScript strict mode

If it doesn't meet these standards, we fix it at no additional cost.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from hiring developers?**
A: We're 5x faster because we use AI for implementation while senior engineers handle architecture. You get a full team (engineering, design, QA) for less than one senior developer's salary.

**Q: What's RANA and why does it matter?**
A: RANA (Rapid AI Native Architecture) is our open-source framework that ensures AI writes production-quality code. It includes 70% automatic cost optimization.

**Q: Do I own the code?**
A: Yes, 100%. Full ownership, no licensing fees, clean handoff. You can take it anywhere.

**Q: What about the 70% cost savings?**
A: RANA automatically optimizes LLM costs through caching, smart model selection, and prompt optimization. This is built into everything we deliver.

**Q: What if I need changes after launch?**
A: First 30 days of bug fixes are included. After that, you can hire us for ongoing work or hand off to your team (we train them).

**Q: Can you work with my existing codebase?**
A: Absolutely. We can integrate with existing systems, refactor legacy code, or start fresh.

**Q: What industries do you work with?**
A: SaaS, e-commerce, education, healthcare, fintech, and more. If it's a web application with AI, we can build it.

**Q: Do you do mobile apps?**
A: We build mobile-responsive web apps and PWAs. For native iOS/Android, we partner with specialized mobile agencies.
