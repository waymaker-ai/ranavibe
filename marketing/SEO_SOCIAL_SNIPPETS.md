## 📝 Boilerplate Text (About RANA)

### Short (50 words):
```
RANA (Rapid AI Native Architecture) is an open-source framework that unifies 9 LLM providers behind a single API. With automatic cost optimization achieving 70% savings, 5-minute setup, and zero vendor lock-in, RANA makes building AI applications as easy as React made building UIs. MIT licensed, free forever.
```

### Medium (100 words):
```
RANA (Rapid AI Native Architecture) is an open-source framework created by Waymaker (Ashley Kays & Christian Moore) that solves the LLM integration chaos. Supporting 9 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Mistral, Cohere, Together, Groq, Ollama) through one unified API, RANA reduces development time from 40+ hours to 5 minutes and cuts costs 70% through automatic smart routing.

Production-deployed across 5 companies with proven $441K/year savings. Built-in enterprise security (OWASP Top 10 + GDPR compliance). Available in TypeScript and Python. Named after Ashley's son, made with love to help developers succeed faster. MIT licensed, free forever.
```

### Long (200 words):
```
RANA (Rapid AI Native Architecture) is a comprehensive open-source framework that addresses the critical fragmentation in AI application development. Created by Waymaker co-founders Ashley Kays and Christian Moore over 18 months, RANA unifies nine major LLM providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Mistral, Cohere, Together.ai, Groq, and Ollama—behind a single, elegant API.

The framework achieves 70% average cost reduction through intelligent routing: simple queries route to cost-effective providers like Gemini Flash ($0.10/1M tokens), while complex tasks use premium providers like Claude or GPT-4 ($3-5/1M tokens). This automatic optimization, combined with built-in response caching, prompt optimization, and RAG implementation, has saved five production deployments a combined $441,000 annually.

Setup takes 5 minutes versus 40+ hours for manual integration. Developers can switch providers with a single line of code, eliminating vendor lock-in. Enterprise-grade security comes built-in, including OWASP Top 10 protection, GDPR compliance tools, PII detection, and rate limiting.

Available in TypeScript and Python (Go SDK coming Q1 2025), RANA works with any framework: Next.js, Express, FastAPI, or custom implementations. Named after Ashley's son—his nickname RANA means "like a piranha"—the framework embodies speed, efficiency, and power. MIT licensed, free forever, with optional Waymaker implementation services.
