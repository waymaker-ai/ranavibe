## 🚫 Red Flags - When to Walk Away

### Don't partner if:
- They want exclusivity (locks out other providers)
- They want to change RANA's core mission
- They want control over messaging
- They don't respect open source
- They want revenue share on RANA (it's MIT licensed)
- Timeline is unrealistic
- Legal terms are onerous

### It's okay to:
- Partner on services (Waymaker can be exclusive)
- Give them preferred positioning (if they earn it)
- Co-create content (as long as it's honest)
- Share revenue from joint offerings
- Have NDA for confidential discussions
