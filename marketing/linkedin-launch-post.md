## Personal Profile Post (Ashley)

🚀 Today, I'm launching RANA - and I want to share why this matters to me personally.

18 months ago, my co-founder Christian Moore and I were frustrated. Every AI project we built for clients started with the same problem:

"Can we switch from OpenAI to Anthropic?"
"Sure - that'll be 40 hours of engineering time."

We were wasting weeks rebuilding the same integration layer. Clients were getting locked into single providers. Costs were spiraling out of control.

**So we built RANA (Rapid AI Native Architecture).**

---

What makes this special:

✅ 9 LLM providers, one unified API
✅ 70% cost reduction (tested on $50K+ monthly spend)
✅ 5-minute setup (vs 40+ hours manual integration)
✅ Zero vendor lock-in
✅ MIT licensed - free forever

But here's the real reason I'm proud of this:

**It's named after my son.** His nickname is RANA (like a piranha 🐟) - fast, efficient, powerful. Every line of code was written with the hope that it helps developers build better products faster.

---

**Real results from production:**

📊 E-commerce company: $22.5K → $6.75K/month (70% cost cut)
📊 SaaS startup: $18K → $5.4K/month
📊 Healthcare platform: $12K → $3.6K/month

**Combined savings: $441,000/year**

---

**Why open source?**

Because I believe the best tools should be accessible to everyone. React changed how we build UIs. I want RANA to change how we build AI applications.

We make money through Waymaker (our agency) offering implementation services - but the framework itself? Free forever.

**Try it:**

```
npx create-rana-app my-app
```

If you're building AI applications, I'd love your feedback. What providers should we add next? What features would help you most?

Drop a comment or DM me. Let's build the future of AI development together.

## Company Page Post (Waymaker)

🎉 Waymaker is proud to announce: RANA v2.0 is now open source!

After 18 months of development and real-world testing across 5 industries, we're releasing RANA (Rapid AI Native Architecture) to the developer community.

**What is RANA?**

A universal framework that makes building production AI applications as easy as React made building UIs.

🔧 One API for 9 LLM providers
💰 70% average cost reduction
⚡ 5-minute setup
🔒 Enterprise security built-in
📖 MIT licensed - free forever

---

**The Problem We Solved:**

Every LLM provider has a different API. Switching costs 40+ hours. Vendor lock-in is real. Cost optimization is manual.

**Our Solution:**

Unified abstraction layer + automatic cost optimization + zero lock-in.

Switch from OpenAI to Anthropic in ONE LINE of code. Reduce costs 70% automatically. Deploy to production in minutes, not weeks.

---

**Real Production Results:**

✅ E-commerce: $189K/year saved
✅ SaaS: $151K/year saved
✅ Healthcare: $100K/year saved

Combined: $441K/year in cost savings across 5 companies.

---

**Why We Built This:**

As an AI development agency, we were rebuilding the same integration layer for every client. We needed something:

- Stable (unlike LangChain's frequent breaking changes)
- Fast (5 minutes, not 40 hours)
- Production-ready (security, monitoring, cost tracking built-in)
- Flexible (9 providers, not 1)

RANA is that solution.

---

**Get Started:**

```bash
npx create-rana-app my-app
```
