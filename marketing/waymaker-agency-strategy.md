- Costs: $2K (tools, hosting)
- Profit: -$2K

**Month 2:**
- Signed: $25K (1 project)
- Revenue: $12.5K (50% upfront from Month 1)
- Costs: $3K
- Profit: $9.5K

**Month 3:**
- Signed: $50K (2 projects)
- Revenue: $37.5K (completion of Month 1, upfront for Month 2)
- Costs: $8K (1 contractor)
- Profit: $29.5K

**Month 4:**
- Signed: $50K (2 projects)
- Revenue: $62.5K
- Costs: $15K (2 contractors)
- Profit: $47.5K

**Month 5:**
- Signed: $75K (3 projects)

- Emergency buffer

### **Optimistic Case**
Double the numbers above = $625K revenue, $449K profit in 6 months

## Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: No Clients**
**Mitigation:**
- Launch with founding client discount (20% off)
- Offer money-back guarantee
- Start with warm network
- Build in public (RANA open source creates inbound)

### **Risk 2: Scope Creep**
**Mitigation:**
- Strict RANA quality gates prevent over-engineering
- Fixed-price, fixed-scope contracts
- Change order process for new features
- Weekly demos keep scope aligned

### **Risk 3: Quality Issues**
**Mitigation:**
- RANA framework prevents common AI mistakes
- Daily deployments catch issues early
- 30-day support period to fix problems
- Code review before delivery

### **Risk 4: Can't Scale**
**Mitigation:**
- Document everything as you go
- Train contractors on RANA
- Build templates for common patterns
- Transition to productized offerings

### **Risk 5: Market Timing**
**Mitigation:**
- Services are recession-resistant (companies need dev)
- RANA differentiation hard to copy
- Faster delivery = better value in any economy
