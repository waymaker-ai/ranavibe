- ✅ API stability (rare breaking changes)
- ✅ 9 LLM providers (vs 4-6)

**LangChain Wins:**
- ✅ Larger community
- ✅ More Python-specific features

**Our Message:** "LangChain for Python experimentation, RANA for TypeScript production."

---

- ✅ MCP support built-in
- ✅ Proven patterns
- ✅ Maintained by community

**Custom Wins:**
- ✅ 100% control (but 100% maintenance)

**Our Message:** "Why spend months building what RANA gives you in 5 minutes?"

---

### vs Other Frameworks (Haystack, Semantic Kernel)
**RANA Wins:**
- ✅ TypeScript/React focus (not just Python/C#)
- ✅ Enterprise security (built-in)

## Messaging Framework

### One-Liner (Twitter Bio)
"Enterprise AI framework with multi-agent orchestration & MCP support. Built by devs, for devs. 🐟"

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"RANA is the only AI framework with enterprise security, multi-agent orchestration, and MCP server creation built-in. Add production-ready AI to your React app in 5 minutes, with zero vendor lock-in. Free forever, with optional Waymaker services."

### Full Pitch (2 minutes)
"Most AI frameworks force you to choose: fast setup OR enterprise security OR multi-agent support. RANA gives you all three.

We built RANA because we were frustrated with existing tools. LangChain breaks with every update. Custom builds take months. Other frameworks don't support TypeScript properly.

RANA is different:
- **Enterprise security built-in** - OWASP Top 10, GDPR, PII masking
- **Multi-agent orchestration** - Coordinate specialized agents seamlessly  
- **MCP server creation** - Build context-aware AI with industry standards
- **9 LLM providers** - Switch in one line, zero lock-in
- **5-minute setup** - Production-ready from day one

It's free forever (MIT license), built by developers who use it in production, and backed by optional Waymaker services for when you need expert help.

Named after my son, the little piranha who inspired me to build something better. 🐟"
