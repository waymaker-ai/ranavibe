## Frequently Asked Questions

### About Finishing Services

**Q: What's the difference between finishing and full development?**
A: Finishing takes your existing prototype (from v0/Bolt/Lovable) and makes it production-ready. Full development builds from scratch. Finishing is 5x faster and 5x cheaper.

**Q: Do you work with any AI code generator?**
A: Yes! We work with v0.dev, Bolt.new, Lovable.dev, Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, and any AI-generated code.

**Q: What if my app is on Bubble or Webflow?**
A: We have a specific "No-Code Finishing" service for that ($3,900). We add custom features no-code platforms can't do.

**Q: How do you guarantee quality scores?**
A: We use AADS framework which has automated quality checks. We run `aads security:check`, `aads seo:check`, `aads mobile:check` and don't deliver until all scores are 95+.

**Q: What if you can't hit the quality scores?**
A: Full refund. No questions asked. (This has never happened because AADS enforces quality automatically.)

**Q: Can I see examples?**
A: Yes! We'll have case studies soon. For now, we're offering the first 5 clients a discount in exchange for testimonials.

**Q: Do I own the code?**
A: 100% yes. You own everything. We just deliver production-ready code to you.

**Q: What's included in 30-day support?**
A: Bug fixes, deployment help, questions answered via Slack/email within 24 hours.

**Q: Can you integrate with my existing backend?**
A: Yes! We can integrate with any API or database.

### About Cost Rescue

**Q: How do you reduce LLM costs 60-70%?**
A: Three strategies: (1) Response caching with Redis (40% savings), (2) Smart model selection - cheap models for simple tasks (25% savings), (3) Prompt optimization (15% savings). Total: 60-70% reduction.

**Q: Does this slow down my app?**
A: No! Caching actually makes it faster. First request takes same time, repeat requests are instant (and free).

**Q: What if my costs don't decrease 50%?**
A: You don't pay. We guarantee at least 50% reduction or it's free.

**Q: Will this work with [my LLM provider]?**
A: Yes. We support OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Google Gemini, and Ollama.

### About Process

**Q: How fast can we start?**
A: 24-48 hours from free audit to starting work.

**Q: Do you work weekends?**
A: If you need faster delivery, yes! (Small rush fee applies)

**Q: What if I need changes after delivery?**
A: First 30 days: Free bug fixes. New features: Quoted separately.

**Q: Can we do a call first?**
A: Absolutely! Book a strategy call anytime.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**
A: Not for finishing services (too fast). For $25K+ projects, yes.
