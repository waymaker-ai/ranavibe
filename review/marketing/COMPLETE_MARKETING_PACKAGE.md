{{firstName}},

Real talk: Most developers waste thousands on LLM costs.

RANA user Sarah Chen cut costs from $1,800 → $450/month.
That's $16,200 saved per year. 💰

How? RANA's automatic optimization:

1. Response Caching (40% savings)
   Save identical queries = instant responses

2. Smart Model Selection (25% savings)
   Route simple tasks to cheap models

3. Prompt Optimization (15% savings)
   Reduce tokens without losing quality

4. RAG Implementation (30% savings)
   Vector DB instead of huge contexts

### Day 14: Advanced Features

**Subject:** Build a full AI agent in under 10 minutes 🐟

**Body:**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

Ready to level up? Today we're building AI agents.

What's an agent? It's AI that can:
- Use tools (search, database, email)
- Execute multi-step tasks
- Make decisions autonomously

RANA makes it stupidly easy:

```typescript
import { agentChat } from '@luka/agents';

const result = await agentChat(
  "What's the weather in NYC and email the summary to team@company.com"
);
```

That's it. The agent will:
1. Call weather API
2. Format the data
3. Send the email
4. Return confirmation

All automatically. Mind = blown 🤯

Try it: https://waymaker.cx/luka/agents

### Week 2: Education

**Day 8 - Twitter (Thread)**
```
🧵 How to build a production AI app in 5 minutes:

1/ Install RANA
```bash
npx create-luka-app my-ai-app
```

2/ Configure providers
```bash
luka llm:setup
```

3/ Build your feature
```typescript
import { luka } from '@luka/client';
const response = await luka.chat({...});
```

4/ Deploy
```bash
luka deploy
```

That's it. Production-ready in 5 minutes.

https://waymaker.cx/luka/quickstart
```

**Day 10 - LinkedIn (Thought Leadership)**
```
Why the future of AI development is multi-provider:

Single-provider lock-in is the new vendor lock-in.

Risks:
• Price increases (you're stuck)
• API changes (breaks your app)
• Downtime (no fallback)
• Rate limits (blocked)

Multi-provider solves this:
• Best model for each task
• Automatic fallback
• Price competition
• Geographic redundancy

RANA makes it trivial:
```typescript
// Same code, 9 providers
const response = await luka.chat({
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash', // or gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet
  messages: [...]
});
```

The future is provider-agnostic.

## 6. Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Waymaker Launches RANA: The First AI Framework with 9 LLM Providers and 70% Cost Reduction**

*Open-source framework cuts setup time from 40 hours to 5 minutes, saves developers $12,600+ annually*

**[City, Date]** – Waymaker today announced the launch of RANA (Layered Utility Kit for AI), a comprehensive, open-source framework that enables developers to build production AI applications 120x faster while reducing costs by 70%.

**The Problem**

Building AI applications currently requires 20-40 hours of infrastructure setup, costs spiral to $1,500+ monthly in LLM fees, and developers face vendor lock-in with single providers. These barriers prevent innovation and make AI development accessible only to well-funded teams.

**The Solution**

RANA is the industry's first AI framework offering:
- **9 LLM Provider Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini 3 & 2.0 Flash, xAI Grok, Mistral AI, Cohere, Together.ai, Groq, and Ollama — all through one unified API
- **70% Cost Reduction**: Automatic optimization through caching, smart routing, and RAG implementation saves average $12,600 annually
- **5-Minute Setup**: From zero to production-ready AI app in 300 seconds vs 40 hours traditionally
- **Enterprise Security**: OWASP Top 10 protection, GDPR compliance tools, and SOC 2 features built-in
- **Production Components**: 20+ UI components with dark mode, accessibility, and mobile-first design

**What Makes RANA Unique**

RANA is the only framework to integrate:
- Hugging Face (350,000+ models)
- OpenAI GPT Store (deploy custom GPTs programmatically)
- Claude MCP (Model Context Protocol for enterprise systems)
- Figma (design-to-code workflow automation)

**Industry Impact**

"Developers waste weeks building infrastructure instead of features," said Ashley Kays, Co-Creator of RANA at Waymaker. "RANA eliminates that friction entirely. We've seen developers cut setup time from days to minutes and reduce LLM costs by 75%. That's real money and real time back in their pockets."

Early adopters report:
- 120x faster setup (5 minutes vs 40 hours)
- 70% cost reduction ($1,500 → $450/month average)
- Zero vendor lock-in (switch providers in one line of code)
- Production-ready security (95+ quality scores enforced)

**Availability**

RANA is available now as a free, open-source framework under the MIT License. Developers can get started at https://waymaker.cx/luka.

**About Waymaker**

Waymaker creates tools that help developers face less friction and achieve more success — faster than ever. Founded by Ashley Kays and Christian Moore, Waymaker is committed to making advanced technology accessible to everyone.

👋 Hey Product Hunt!

Ashley here, co-creator of RANA with Christian Moore.

We built RANA because we were tired of:
❌ Spending 40 hours setting up AI infrastructure
❌ Watching LLM costs spiral to $1,500+/month
❌ Being locked into one provider
❌ Building security from scratch

6 months later, RANA is here:
✅ 9 LLM providers through one API
✅ 70% automatic cost reduction
✅ 5-minute setup (we timed it!)
✅ Enterprise security built-in

**Quick Wins:**
1. Use our cost calculator to see YOUR savings: [link]
2. Try the live demo (no signup): [link]
3. Deploy your first AI app in 5 min: [link]

**Special for Product Hunt:**
🎁 First 100 users get RANA University early access (launching soon)

We're here all day answering questions!

**FAQ Responses (Prepare These):**

Q: "How is this different from LangChain?"
A: "Great question! LangChain is excellent for chains/agents but doesn't include UI components, security, or cost optimization. RANA is a complete framework: LLM providers + UI + security + deployment + marketing tools. Think of it as 'LangChain + Vercel AI SDK + security + design system' in one."

Q: "Is it really free?"
A: "Yes! 100% free and open source (MIT License). All features, all providers, forever. We offer optional paid services (training, custom dev) for teams that want extra support, but the framework itself is completely free."

Q: "Which LLM provider is cheapest?"
A: "Depends on your use case! Generally: Gemini 2.0 Flash ($0.10/1M tokens) for multimodal, GPT-4o-mini for simple tasks, Groq for speed. Our cost calculator compares all 9: [link]"

Q: "Does it work with Python?"
A: "Currently TypeScript/JavaScript. Python support is coming in v2.1 (Jan 2026). You can follow progress here: [link]"

Q: "Can I use this in production?"
A: "Absolutely! RANA enforces quality gates: 95+ security score, 90+ SEO score, 95+ mobile score. Several companies are already running RANA in production."

Building AI Apps is Broken

❌ 40 hours of infrastructure setup
❌ $1,500+/month in LLM costs
❌ Vendor lock-in (one provider)
❌ Security vulnerabilities everywhere
❌ No design system or components
❌ Deployment takes days

Result: Developers waste weeks building infrastructure instead of features
```

```
Who This Hurts:

Solo Developers
• Can't compete with funded startups
• Waste time on infrastructure

Startups
• Burn runway on avoidable costs
• Slow time-to-market

Agencies
• Can't scale AI projects profitably
• Thin margins on client work

Enterprises
