# Implementation Notes

## Key Changes from Current Page:

### 1. **Lead with Finishing Services** (NEW)
- Hero focuses on 7-day finishing (not full builds)
- First section: Finishing services + packages
- Second section: Full development (existing services)
- This captures high-margin, fast-turnaround business

### 2. **Keep Existing Services** (PRESERVED)
- All current services remain
- Positioned as "Or Build From Scratch"
- Same pricing, same descriptions
- No disruption to existing clients

### 3. **Two Clear Paths**
- Path 1: "Fast-Track" (finishing) - for prototypes
- Path 2: "Build From Scratch" (full dev) - for new projects
- Clear distinction helps visitors self-select

### 4. **Pricing Transparency**
- All prices visible upfront
- Package deals show savings
- Clear comparison table
- Removes pricing friction

### 5. **AADS Framework Integration**

## Conversion Optimizations:

1. **Multiple CTAs for Different Stages**

   - Book service (high barrier)

2. **Risk Reversal**
   - Money-back guarantee (finishing)
   - Fixed pricing (no surprises)
   - Free audit first (no obligation)

3. **Social Proof**

   - Add new case studies as available
   - AADS framework as proof

4. **Clear Positioning**

## SEO Keywords to Target:
