# Waymaker Agency Services - Executive Launch Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Status:** Ready to Launch
**Timeline:** Launch this weekend, first client within 7 days
**Revenue Target:** $21,000 Month 1 (5 clients)

---

## 🎯 What We're Launching

### The Big Idea: "AI Code Finishing"

**Market Opportunity:**
- v0.dev, Bolt.new, Lovable.dev are exploding in popularity
- They generate prototypes in minutes BUT they're not production-ready
- 90% of AI-generated apps need professional finishing
- Nobody is specifically positioning as a "finishing service"
- **This is a blue ocean market**

**Your Unique Position:**
- **AADS Framework** = Your competitive moat (automated quality checks)
- **Fast delivery** = 7 days vs 30+ days (traditional agencies)
- **High margins** = 60-70% vs 40-50% (full development)
- **Lower price** = $4,900 vs $10K-$25K (traditional finishing)
- **Perfect timing** = AI code generation exploding in 2025

## 🚨 Common Questions

### "Can I really deliver this manually?"
**Yes.** The first 3-5 clients will take more time, but you can deliver in 7 days. Document as you go, build AADS CLI to automate. By client 10+, mostly automated.

### "What if I can't hit the quality scores?"
**Use AADS CLI** (even partially complete) to enforce quality. The framework ensures 95+ scores automatically. If you're delivering manually, test thoroughly before handoff.

### "Should I offer discounts to first clients?"
**Yes.** Charge $3,900 for first 5 clients (vs $4,900 regular). In exchange: video testimonial and permission for case study. This speeds up closes and builds social proof.

### "What if someone wants changes after delivery?"
**Set clear expectations:** Bug fixes free for 30 days. New features quoted separately. Document everything in your proposal.

### "How do I find customers?"
**Three ways:**
1. Free audits on Twitter/X (this weekend)
2. Google Ads ($10-20/day initially)
3. Engage with v0/Bolt/Lovable users on social media

### "Should I focus on v0 or Bolt or all of them?"
**Start with v0.** It's the most popular. Once you have process dialed in, add Bolt and Lovable (same process, different branding).
